This is my personal website. I blog about visualizations. Mostly, it is inspired by bread baking.

This site is very much in it's preliminary stages. It may split into 2 sites - a baking & cooking focused blog a separate site for my professional content. Right now, it is Bread the Whole Time.

## Roadmap
 - Create a blog post for every Tableau Public Viz
 - Create a Cocktails viz with my Tableau cocktail menu.
 - Populate some about me content
