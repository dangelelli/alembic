Gran Classico is one of my favorite spirits. It was sort of a stepping stone for me into drinking [amari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaro_\(liqueur\)).
One of my coworkers is a big fan of Campari, which is the bitter liqueur in Negronis and a few other classic cocktails. I made this viz as a fun way to compare the two spirits. I'm definitely partial to Gran Classico and I think my (subjective) viz makes that clear. I especially like the radar chart in this viz because it shows how one item (Gran Classico) almost completely overtakes the other (Campari).
