This blog is inspired by my love of baking and my love of fiction. I am especially happy when these coincide and I can bring an on-theme loaf of **Bread the Whole Time** to a book club or film viewing.


Some of my favorite characters who were bread the whole time.

 - Juan Preciado from *Pedro Peramo* by Juan Rulfo
 - Maybe Rick Deckard in *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep* by Philip K Dick - replace "dead" with "replicant" but it's the same idea.
 - Also Rachel Rosen in *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep* by Philip K Dick
 - Pick any character from *Westworld* - see Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep
 - Malcolm Crowe in *The Sixth Sense*
