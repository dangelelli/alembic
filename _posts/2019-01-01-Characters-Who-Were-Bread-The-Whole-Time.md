This blog is inspired by my love of baking and my love of fiction. I am especially happy when these coincide and I can bring an on-theme loaf of **Bread the Whole Time** to a book club or film viewing.


Some of my favorite characters or stories that were bread the whole time.

 - *Pedro Peramo* by Juan Rulfo. This book led to the name of the blog.
 - *An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge* by Ambrose Bierce.
 - Rachel Rosen and maybe Rick Deckard in *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep* by Philip K Dick - replace "dead" with "replicant" but it's the same idea.
 - Pick almost any character from *Westworld* - see Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.
 - Jacob's Ladder
 - Malcolm Crowe in *The Sixth Sense*
